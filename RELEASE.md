# Release process

## Versions

Semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **PATCH** – fixes only; no new settings, no schema change, no change to the public API (`API.md`, `vcap/v1`).
- **MINOR** – new features, new settings or filters, additive schema changes (`VCAP_DB_VERSION` is bumped).
- **MAJOR** – anything that breaks a documented filter, the REST/PHP redemption contract or stored data.

The version lives in three places that must agree – `bin/build.sh` refuses to build otherwise:

1. plugin header `Version:` in `voucher-captain.php`,
2. `define( 'VCAP_VERSION', … )` in the same file,
3. `Stable tag:` in `readme.txt`.

## Changelog

`readme.txt` → `== Changelog ==` is the changelog. Work in progress collects under `= Unreleased =`; at release
time that heading becomes `= X.Y.Z =` (the release workflow refuses a tag without that section and uses it as the
release notes). Entries start with **New**, **Fix** or **Fix (security)** and describe the effect for the shop.

## Cutting a release

1. Merge the release branch into `main`; CI (`Plugin smoke tests`) must be green, including the multisite,
   minimum-versions, Pass Captain and browser jobs.
2. Work through `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` (the manual checks).
3. Bump the version in the three places above, rename `= Unreleased =` to `= X.Y.Z =`, commit.
4. Tag that commit and push the tag:

   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Voucher Captain X.Y.Z"
   ```

   ```bash
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

5. The `Release` workflow checks tag ↔ version, builds the ZIP twice (identical SHA-256 required) and creates a
   **draft** GitHub release with `voucher-captain.zip` and `voucher-captain.zip.sha256`. Review and publish it.
6. Upload the same ZIP and its SHA-256 to the licence manager's release storage (premium updates verify the hash).

## Reproducible ZIP

`bin/build.sh` builds `build/voucher-captain.zip` and `build/voucher-captain.zip.sha256`. Identical sources give a
byte-identical ZIP: file times are set to `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` (default: time of the last commit; the POT header uses
it too), entries are sorted, extra attributes are left out and the Composer autoloader suffix is fixed. Anyone can
rebuild a tag and compare the hash with the published one:

```bash
git checkout vX.Y.Z && bin/build.sh && cat build/voucher-captain.zip.sha256
```
